Choose at least three languages
Ruby
C#
JavaScript


One branch should return one result. It shouldn't be possible to be suggested two languages at once.


Make sure that when the user submits the survey again (for a second or third time), that previous answers are hidden, cleared, or replaced prior to showing the new result.


Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. 


For the branching logic, you are not required to take every possible combination of answers into account. Feel free to use very simple logic, or even ignore the user's responses for some questions as long as you show some good functionality and offer a minimum of 3 languages.

Do not use window methods to interact with the user. This includes window.alert(), window.confirm(), and window.prompt(). Instead use a form to gather user input and event handler properties or event listeners to handle events. To display the survey results to the user, you can show and hide HTML or update the values of existing HTML elements to communicate results.
